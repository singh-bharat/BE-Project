# BE-Project

This project combines two approaches (i.e use of Victim Cache and Adaptive Cache Replacement Algorithm) for improving the performance of Cache.

"normal.py" is a python script that simulates the behavior of a normal cache (that does not uses Victim Cache and ACR technique).

"vc.py" is a python script that simulates the behavior of a Memory hierarchy that uses Victim Cache also.

"vc_plus_acr.py" is a python script that simulates the behavior of a memory hierarchy that employs Victim Cache as well as ACR in memory hierarchy.

When these three are compared against the same datasets (i.e. random.txt, randommix.txt etc.), we observed improvement in performance of Cache.
